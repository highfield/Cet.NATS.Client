# Cet.NATS.Client
A C# client for NATS brokers.

> The fastest yet simplest way to exchange messages (after hairdressers, of course).

## Intro
This piece of software was created as a spin-off of the official Apcera's NATS C# client: https://github.com/nats-io/csharp-nats

From the original sources, the resulting code was almost completely rewritten, having the latest .Net features in mind. Motivations were: performance, low-resources need, and thread safety.

Main credits go to Apcera, which is the NATS project owner.

## Features
Here are some of the features:
- the library targets .Net Standard 2.0
- passive and reactive consumer interface
- sync and async interface

> NOTE: this library exposes APIs which are different from the original version.
